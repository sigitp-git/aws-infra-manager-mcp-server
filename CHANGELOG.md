- **Complex Configuration**: Removed unnecessary configuration complexity

### Security

#### Enhanced Security Posture
- **Read-Only by Design**: All operations are read-only, eliminating risk of accidental changes
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Reduced functionality means fewer potential security issues
- **Standard AWS Security**: Relies on proven AWS SDK security practices
- **No Custom Authentication**: Uses standard AWS credential mechanisms

#### Required Permissions
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs", 
        "ec2:DescribeRegions",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
        "lambda:ListFunctions"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies
- **FastMCP**: >=0.2.0 for MCP protocol support
- **boto3**: >=1.34.0 for AWS API interactions
- **botocore**: >=1.34.0 for AWS core functionality
- **Python**: 3.10+ required

#### Testing & Validation
- **Real AWS Testing**: Tested with actual AWS services and resources
- **Kiro Integration Testing**: Verified working integration with Kiro IDE
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Tested credential and permission error handling
- **Import Testing**: Verified all imports and module structure work correctly

#### Performance
- **Client Caching**: AWS service clients are cached for better performance
- **Session Management**: Efficient AWS session handling
- **Fast Startup**: Minimal dependencies for quick server startup
- **Low Memory**: Efficient memory usage with focused functionality

### Migration from v0.1.0

#### Breaking Changes
- **Tool Reduction**: Many tools from v0.1.0 are no longer available
- **Configuration Changes**: MCP configuration format has changed
- **API Changes**: Function signatures may have changed for remaining tools
- **Dependency Changes**: Some dependencies may no longer be required

#### Migration Steps
1. **Update MCP Configuration**: Use the new configuration format
2. **Update Tool Usage**: Verify which tools are still available
3. **Test Integration**: Verify MCP server connects and works correctly

- **Test Early and Often**: Real-world testing reveals issues that unit tests miss
- **Framework Constraints**: Understanding framework limitations prevents compatibility issues
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Documentation must reflect actual working code

#### Legacy Features (Non-Functional)
- 50+ AWS tools that were planned but not working
- Complex CLI interface that had import issues
